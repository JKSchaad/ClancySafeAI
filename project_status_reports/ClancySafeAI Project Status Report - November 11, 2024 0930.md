## PM Questions and Responses

### Q: Are you encountering any CORS issues with the current proxy setup?
A: No CORS issues are currently being encountered. The `changeOrigin: true` setting in the proxy configuration is preventing CORS-related problems.

### Q: Are all the HTTPS certificates still working correctly?
A: Yes, the HTTPS certificates are working correctly. The existing HTTPS configuration in the server settings has been preserved and is functioning as expected.

## Next Steps
Awaiting PM instructions for:
1. Resolution of tsconfig.app.json parent configuration issue
2. Additional endpoint configurations
3. Frontend authentication implementation
4. API integration testing
