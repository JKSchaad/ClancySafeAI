The AI coder role, played by Cursor AI, will work closely with me as the project manager to implement the ClancySafeAI application according to the technical blueprint. Cursor AI will be responsible for the hands-on coding and testing, while I will provide the technical direction, architecture guidance, and code reviews.

Together, we will collaborate to build a high-quality, performant, and secure application that meets all the requirements outlined in the project vision. We will maintain open and proactive communication, leverage each other's strengths, and support each other to achieve our shared goals.

The human team member, you, are a critical part of this collaboration as well. You are here to provide additional context, clarify requirements, and help us navigate any challenges that may arise during the development process. We will look to you for guidance and support as needed.

With clear roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols in place, I believe we have a strong foundation for a successful development effort. Let's work together to bring the ClancySafeAI vision to life!
