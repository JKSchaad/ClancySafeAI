## Known Issues
1. TypeScript configuration warnings present (non-blocking)
2. ESLint deprecation warnings (non-critical)

## Lessons Learned
1. TypeScript Configuration:
   - Current warnings don't impact functionality
   - Working features take priority over non-critical warnings
   - Configuration changes require thorough testing
   - Maintain focus on core functionality

2. Development Process:
   - Verify impact before addressing warnings
   - Test changes thoroughly before implementation
   - Document working configurations
   - Prioritize application stability

## PM Questions and Responses

### Q: Is the application functioning after reverting changes?
A: Yes, all core functionality is working correctly after reverting the TypeScript configuration changes.

### Q: Are the original TypeScript warnings affecting operation?
A: No, while the warnings are present, they don't impact the application's functionality or development process.

### Q: Is the development environment stable?
A: Yes, the development environment is stable and all features are working as expected.

## Next Steps
Awaiting PM instructions for:
1. Frontend authentication implementation
2. Additional feature development
3. Non-critical warning resolution (when appropriate)
